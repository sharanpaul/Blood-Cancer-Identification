# Blood-Cancer-Identification
Cancer is a deadly disease and the Initial detection of cancer is the best way to cure the disease. Medical Image Processing plays an essential part in the detection of disease. 
Leukemia is a kind of blood cancer that happens due to irregular or immature White Blood Cell (WBC)s. Abnormal growth of WBC from bone marrow will destroy the other cells and affect bone marrow and lymphatic tissues.
But it takes more time for counting and gives inaccurate results. To overcome these issues, a software based solution is given with the help of microscopic images. With this image processing technique, 
whether a person can be affected by leukemia or not is identified. The evaluation and diagnosis of blood cancer related diseases can be complex and lengthy. 
In the last decade, different tools have been created to detect, analyze and classify blood cancer in humans. 
In this project, we present our current effort on the development of a Deep Learning Model capable of identifying blood cell anomalies.
We use Hybrid Ensemble Deep Learning to identify blood cancer from two Mixed Neural Network (MNN) and transfer learning to extract features from each input image. 
By combining two distinct Mixed Neural Network to improve the ensemble model's ability to predict and generalize. 
A model like this may enhance early disease identification and prevention, resulting in quicker medical diagnoses. It is one of the most advanced deep learning techniques which can able to give accuracy over 99%.
